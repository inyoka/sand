SAND Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
--------------------------------------------

25 Questions designed to assess Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity, Peer and Prosocial levels.

The project takes in questionnaire answers via radio buttons and computes the results, before finally exporting to a PDF report.

This project is far from complete and should not be used in its current state.  Pull requests are welcomed.

Built using SetupTools into a distributable appâ€¦
