SAND Strengths and Difficulties Questionaire
--------------------------------------------

25 Questions designed to assess Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity, Peer and Prosocial levels.


The project takes in questionaire answers via radio buttons and computes the results, before finally exporting to a PDF report.

This project is far from complete and should not be used in its current state.  Pull requests are welcomed.
