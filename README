SAND Strengths and Difficulties Questionaire
--------------------------------------------

25 Questions designed to assess Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity, Peer and Prosocial levels.

This project aims to provide the current paperbased questionaire, in an easily sharable program using if possible only the standard library.

The project takes in questionaire answers via radio buttons and computes the results, before finally exporting to a PDF report.

This project is far from complete and should not be used in its current state.  Pull requests are welcomed.
